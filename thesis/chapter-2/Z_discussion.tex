We have shown that the SNR of a \SI{1}{\micro\second\per\pixel} image subject to a bias potential outperforms that of a \SI{20}{\micro\second\per\pixel} unbiased image. This has important ramifications for large-scale and volume EM studies in which throughput is a primary concern. Due to practical limitations on time, it is often the case that large-scale EM studies are conducted on a single specimen. Negative potential bias facilitates comparison studies by allowing for multiple specimens to be acquired in the same timeframe that would otherwise be necessary for a single specimen. Experiments on specimens prone to electron beam irradiation damage are likewise facilitated as the same SNR can be achieved with a considerably smaller electron dose.

Our simulations show that BSE collection is enhanced by an effective increase of the detector numerical apertureâ€”by applying the bias potential we increase the range of angular distributions of the BSEs able to be collected. However, this does not fully explain the extent of the increase in SNR observed experimentally. In particular, the simulations predict roughly a factor two increase in signal collection as the bias voltage is raised to our maximum of \SI{3}{\kilo\volt}, while our empirical measurements show SNR improvements of one to two orders of magnitude. This disparity can be explained in part by the electron gain factor of the detector. Sakic et al. \cite{vsakic2011boron} shows that the signal generated in the detector by the incident electrons increases linearly with energy between \SIrange{200}{1000}{\electronvolt}. Thus, in addition to increasing the amount of collected BSEs, the bias potential also leads to signal enhancement via BSE acceleration. At low bias voltages the images appear to be dominated by one particular source of noise---which we suspect derives from the scanning electronics. Increasing the bias potential in this regime leads to an exponential rise in the SNR as this noise source is drowned out (Figure \ref{fig:3.8_noise}). At sufficiently high bias voltages, the image noise is instead dominated by shot noise, stemming the exponential rise in SNR beyond \SI{1.5}{\kilo\volt}. The practical limit to the amount of bias potential we are able to apply is limited by the dielectric breakdown in vacuum. We estimate for our particular setup that the breakdown voltage occurs above \SI{3}{\kilo\volt}---well beyond the point at which the SNR plateaus.

    Top: sequence of \SI{5}{\micro\second} dwell tissue images acquired in immersion mode with varying amounts of stage bias. Center: 2D PSDs of tissue images showing the central spot, which represents most of the signal, becoming more prominent with increasing bias potential up to \SI{-1.5}{\kilo\volt}. The 2D PSDs exhibit noticeable streak artefacts at higher frequencies, particularly in the lower bias potential images. We attribute these streaks to electric interference from the scanning electronics. Furthermore, there is a constant offset, which is likely a combination of shot noise from various sources, and may also include a component from the scanning electronics. Bottom: Azimuthally averaged power spectral density estimates show a division between the low frequency (primarily signal) and high frequency (primarily noise) portions of the tissue images. As the suspected scanning electronics noise is drowned out, the SNR improves dramatically. Scale bar: \SI{500}{\nano\meter}.}

Negative bias potential can be combined with imaging strategies currently in use for large-scale EM, such as the multi-scale approach taken by Hildebrand et al. \cite{hildebrand2017whole}. The combination with an integrated microscope as demonstrated here could then offer a further benefit by in-situ selection of the regions of interest for high magnification acquisition. We envision a strategy in which regions of interest are first identified via fluorescence microscopy, then automatically navigated to and imaged with high resolution EM \cite{koning2019integrated}. Higher throughput could then be realized through a combination of faster acquisition via the negative bias potential, the removal of additional rounds of imaging, and the elimination of overhead from the entire imaging pipeline.

Further throughput enhancement could be obtained in several ways. One option would be to increase the current, thus increasing the per-pixel electron dose. However, doing so can come at the expense of resolution. Higher beam currents require larger aperture sizes which result in greater chromatic and spherical aberration. This can be problematic for many biological applications in which keeping aberrations at a minimum is critical for reaching a desired resolution, e.g. resolving neuronal connections, nuclear pores, or cell-cell junctions. Alternatively, the signal may be strengthened by increasing the landing energy. This may also be disadvantageous as too great a landing energy will result in partial transmission of electrons through the tissue section. In addition to reducing the number of generated BSEs in the tissue, this will increase the noise level by detection of accelerated BSEs generated in the underlying substrate. Finally, more signal could be generated by increasing the amount of staining material in the sample. This is a common approach for certain applications within large-scale EM such as neuronal connectomics, where an almost binary level of contrast may still be acceptable \cite{kuipers2015scanning}. Our stage bias approach holds promise to decrease acquisition times also in these applications, provided the lower limit imposed on dwell time by the detector response time is not reached.
