\chapter[Label-free fluorescence predictions]{Label-free fluorescence predictions from large-scale correlative light and electron microscopy data}
\label{chap:4}

% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
    Electron microscopy (EM) provides high-resolution images of (sub-)cellular ultrastructure. Identifying particular organelles or proteins of interest from EM images alone, however, is often a challenge. Deep learning-based approaches have rapidly been adopted within biological EM to perform structural recognition tasks, such as organelle segmentation, due to their strength in pattern inference and analyzing visual imagery.
    Such approaches require large training datasets, typically at the expense of hundreds of hours of human annotation. As an alternative means of providing biological labels to EM datasets, we developed CLEMnet, a deep convolutional neural network that has been trained on large-scale ({$\sim$}\SI{16}{GB}) correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) data. 
    These datasets have been compiled via integrated array tomography such that manual annotation is not required for generating predictions.
    CLEMnet predictions generated on EM images unseen by the network are highly correlated with the measured fluorescence signal.
    As the biological labels generated by the network are localized to specific cellular features and organelles, we additionally assess the feasibility of the correlative fluorescence data and network-generated predictions as training masks for organelle segmentation. Segmentation models trained on these masks significantly underperform those trained on masks made by hand, overall segmentation performance is greatly improved by minimal human annotation.
