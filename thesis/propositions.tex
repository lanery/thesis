\section{Propositions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Researchers doing SEM-based backscattered electron imaging of biological tissue without the use of a negative potential bias are wasting time. \\
    \textit{This proposition pertains to this dissertation.}
    \item Integrated array tomography is the most viable solution for acquiring large-scale correlative light and electron microscopy datasets with sub-micron registration precision. \\
    \textit{This proposition pertains to this dissertation.}
    \item By mitigating nonspecific labeling artefacts and correcting for registration errors, neural networks are capable of providing higher quality fluorescence information than fluorescence microscopes. \\
    \textit{This proposition pertains to this dissertation.}
    \item The future of correlative light and electron microscopy relies on improved protocols for sample preparation rather than instrumentation. \\
    \textit{This proposition pertains to this dissertation.}
    \item The next revolution in dense reconstruction of biological specimen will come from X-ray nano-tomography.
    \item A civilization is more likely to conquer its neighbor if it began food production first.
    \item The best way to ensure the survival of our planet is for all humans not working on an asteroid-detonation strategy to die.
    \item If intelligent lifeforms existed elsewhere in our galaxy, we would be aware of them by now.
    \item By manufacturing women's clothing with impractical or nonexistent pockets, the fashion industry has exploited women into the purchasing of hand bags.
    \item The Technical University of Delft should not tout its ``green" credentials whilst hiding the glass recycling in the basement of Building 22.
    \item Art is not open to interpretation; it means precisely what the artist meant it to and nothing more.
    \item The key factor in the success of a city is a diversified labor market.
