Emily: 
% I wasn't sure what to say here, after thinking about it I decided that this is an acknowledgments section and 
I met some incredible people, had some unforgettable experiences. I also got divorced, lost my dog, and ended up living in someone's attic. Kind of a mixed bag.
A big part of me wanted to not say anything here, but this is an acknowledgments section and it would be disingenuous not to acknowledge something about this as it affected my PhD more than any other event. You brought me incredible happiness and incredible/unbearable pain. But in dealing with the pain

Luc: I have to admit, I found it mildly frustrating to share an office with someone with better English than me.

Arent: thanks for teaching me Biology 101. If not for you I still wouldn't know why there is mitochondria in brain tissue or why octopuses don't have a blind spot (apparently their nerve cells are behind their retina). 
% God sure has a sense of humor
% What kind of benevolent god would allow such a thing?

Yoram: congrats on beating me, but you guys had an advantage because you're dutch and you didn't go through a divorce.

Chetan:
